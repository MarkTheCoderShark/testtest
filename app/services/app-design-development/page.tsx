const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How long does it take to develop a mobile app from start to finish?",
    answer: "The development timeline for a mobile app typically ranges from 3-6 months for a basic app to 6-12 months for a complex application. The timeline depends on several factors including the app's complexity, number of features, platform requirements (iOS, Android, or both), and the development approach chosen. We use agile development methodologies to ensure rapid iteration and timely delivery, with regular check-ins and milestone reviews throughout the process."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between native and cross-platform app development?",
    answer: "Native app development involves building separate applications for each platform (iOS and Android) using platform-specific languages and tools. This approach provides the best performance and access to platform-specific features but requires more development time and resources. Cross-platform development uses frameworks like React Native or Flutter to build a single codebase that works on multiple platforms. This approach is faster and more cost-effective but may have some performance limitations and reduced access to platform-specific features."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the security of mobile applications?",
    answer: "We implement multiple layers of security including secure coding practices, data encryption, secure API communication, user authentication and authorization, and regular security audits. We also ensure compliance with industry standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2. Our security approach includes threat modeling, penetration testing, and ongoing security monitoring. We work closely with security experts to stay current with the latest security threats and best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with app store optimization and marketing?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive app store optimization (ASO) services including keyword optimization, compelling app descriptions, high-quality screenshots and videos, and user review management. We also offer marketing support including social media promotion, influencer partnerships, and paid advertising campaigns. Our team works with you to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that maximizes your app's visibility and user acquisition."
  },
  {
    question: "What ongoing support and maintenance do you provide after launch?",
    answer: "We provide comprehensive post-launch support including bug fixes, performance monitoring, security updates, feature enhancements, and user support. Our maintenance packages include regular updates, performance optimization, security patches, and 24/7 monitoring. We also provide analytics and reporting to help you understand user behavior and app performance. Our team is always available to address any issues and ensure your app continues to perform optimally."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle scalability and future growth of applications?",
    answer: "We design applications with scalability in mind from the start, using cloud-native architectures, microservices, and auto-scaling capabilities. Our development approach includes performance testing, load balancing, and database optimization to ensure your app can handle increased user loads. We also implement monitoring and analytics to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. As your business grows, we can help scale your application infrastructure and add new features to meet evolving needs."
