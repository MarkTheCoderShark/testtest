const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How long does it take to develop custom enterprise software?",
    answer: "The development timeline for custom enterprise software typically ranges from 4-8 months for a basic system to 8-18 months for a complex enterprise solution. The timeline depends on several factors including the software's complexity, number of features, integration requirements, and the development approach chosen. We use agile development methodologies to ensure rapid iteration and timely delivery, with regular check-ins and milestone reviews throughout the process."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between custom software and off-the-shelf solutions?",
    answer: "Custom software is specifically designed and built for your business needs, offering perfect alignment with your processes and requirements. Off-the-shelf solutions are pre-built software packages that may require workarounds or compromises to fit your business needs. Custom software provides better integration, scalability, and competitive advantage, while off-the-shelf solutions offer faster deployment and lower initial costs. The choice depends on your specific business requirements and long-term goals."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure the security of enterprise software?",
    answer: "We implement multiple layers of security including secure coding practices, data encryption, secure authentication and authorization, regular security audits, and compliance with industry standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR. Our security approach includes threat modeling, penetration testing, and ongoing security monitoring. We work closely with security experts to stay current with the latest security threats and best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with software integration and data migration?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive software integration and data migration services. This includes API development, system integration, data migration from legacy systems, real-time data synchronization, and error handling. We ensure seamless data flow across your organization while maintaining data integrity and security. Our team has extensive experience integrating various software systems and can handle complex integration scenarios."
  },
  {
    question: "What ongoing support and maintenance do you provide after deployment?",
    answer: "We provide comprehensive post-deployment support including bug fixes, performance monitoring, security updates, feature enhancements, and user support. Our maintenance packages include regular updates, performance optimization, security patches, and 24/7 monitoring. We also provide analytics and reporting to help you understand system performance and user behavior. Our team is always available to address any issues and ensure your software continues to perform optimally."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle scalability and future growth of software systems?",
    answer: "We design software with scalability in mind from the start, using cloud-native architectures, microservices, and auto-scaling capabilities. Our development approach includes performance testing, load balancing, and database optimization to ensure your software can handle increased user loads and data volumes. We also implement monitoring and analytics to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. As your business grows, we can help scale your software infrastructure and add new features to meet evolving needs."
